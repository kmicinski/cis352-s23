        <h2 id="programming-languages-theory-and-practice">Programming Languages: Theory and Practice</h2>
<p>(<em>CIS 352</em> at Syracuse U)</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: parts of this syllabus are subject to change with adequate
notice to students.</p>

<p>An introduction to the design and implementation of programming
languages, focused on operational semantics and interpreters. This
course is heavily project-focused, and a specific emphasis will be
placed upon training in algorithmic thinking and programming strategy.</p>

<p><b>Instructors:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Kris Micinski, Asst. Prof at Syracuse ECS
    <ul>
      <li>Office hours (CST 4-185): Tu/Th for an hour after class.</li>
      <li>Additional office hours (Zoom preferred, but in-person is fine if needed) are also available by appointment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Jack Levin (TA), MS student at Syracuse ECS
    <ul>
      <li>Office hours: Monday/Wednesday 3-4PM, CST 0-123</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Workload</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Asynchronous video lecture units (at most ~80min per week)
    <ul>
      <li>I assume you have watched the videos before class; but no big
pressure to understand everything, I will recap during
class. However, please think of recorded lectures as “the book.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>5 projects</li>
  <li>2 midterms, 1 final (both 20%, lowest drops)</li>
  <li>This will be a project-focused course. Approximately 3-5 hours per
week outside of class is expected. I recommend against taking this
course concurrent with other project-heavy courses.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Exams – 40%</strong></li>
  <li>Two midterms, one final. Each exam is worth 20%, and lowest of the
three drops. Midterms cover 5 of 10 learning objectives (see links
at top of page); particular focus topics will be announced on Zulip
or in class a day or two before the exam. Students are allowed a
handwritten, one-sided, US letter-sized note sheet. The final is
comprehensive and includes 10 questions.</li>
  <li>For both midterms (but not the final) students are allowed to write
corrections and get back 50% for each problem on which they made a
“good faith attempt” (some not-insignificat effort towards a
solution).</li>
  <li><strong>Projects – 60%</strong></li>
  <li>Five projects, worth 12% each.</li>
</ul>

<p>Final grades will be assigned as follows. A small “bump” may be given
in practice, but is not guaranteed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A  – 90%</li>
  <li>A-  – 88%</li>
  <li>B+ – 85%</li>
  <li>B  – 82%</li>
  <li>B- – 78%</li>
  <li>C+ – 74%</li>
  <li>C  – 70%</li>
  <li>C- – 65%</li>
  <li>D  – 60%</li>
  <li>&lt; D – &lt; 60%</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="topics">Topics</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Functional programming in Racket/Scheme</li>
  <li>Forms and callsites</li>
  <li>Lexical environments and scoping</li>
  <li>Textual reduction semantics</li>
  <li>Structural recursion over inductively-defined lists</li>
  <li>Higher order functions (lambdas) and their properties</li>
  <li>Cons diagrams and boxes</li>
  <li>Quasiquoting and pattern matching</li>
  <li>Tail calls and tail recursion</li>
  <li>Metacircular interpreters</li>
  <li>Natural deduction</li>
  <li>Small-step semantics</li>
  <li>Lambda calculus</li>

  <li>Fixed points and fixed point combinators</li>
  <li>Simply-typed lambda calculus</li>
  <li>Nominal type systems for object orientation</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="projects">Projects</h4>

<p>There are <em>five programming projects</em> in Racket. Projects will
generally have deadlines of roughly 12 calendar days from their
assignment (though this may be adjusted at times). Projects will be
graded using an <em>autograder</em> whose URL is
<a href="https://autograde.org">https://autograde.org</a>. You will receive
credentials for the autograder–if you have not received these by the
second week of class, let the professor know. You are expected to
learn how to use the Git interface to the autograder–the autograder
will technically accept archives, but the instructors strongly prefer
students (and will exclusively help support) using Git.</p>

<h5 id="project-late-policy">Project Late Policy</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Projects turned in within 72 hours of the deadline will receive a 15
percent penalty. Projects turned in after 72 hours and until the end
of the course will receive a 25 percent penalty.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="exams">Exams</h4>

<p>Exams explicitly measure your ability to materialize solutions to
questions regarding relevant course content in an open-ended
fashion. There will be two midterms both with roughly five questions
each. Questions will be drawn from the learning objectives at the top
of the page.</p>

<p>We realize exams can be stressful. The instructors strongly encourage
students to look into the resources provided by the Barnes Center
(such as extended exam time) if a student thinks their academic
performance is impeded by exam-related stress. We are happy to provide
accomodations for exams, but the instructors request at least 72 hours
notice for each exam so that we may upload the necessary material to
the student testing center.</p>

<h4 id="collaboration-and-the-honor-code">Collaboration and the Honor Code</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Projects and exams must be completed alone, without exception.</li>
  <li>Specifically, you must <em>never</em> send your code to anyone or allow
anyone to watch you code, obtain your code, study your code, copy
your code, etc… We expect you will take reasonable precautious to
ensure the secrecy of your solutions (e.g., closing your laptop
before leaving your apartment, if living with other students).</li>
  <li>The autograder employs elaborate cheat-detection techniques,
including advanced static analyses. These techniques will compare
your code to other students’ submissions, along with students from
previous semesters. The TAs and instructor will be using these
features to periodically scan for students who are cheating. Past
experience shows us that this system is very robust, and has allowed
us to detect several large clusters of collaborating students; all
violations ever reported in CIS352 have been upheld by the Syracuse
University academic integrity council.</li>
  <li>All apparent cases (with credible evidence, as determined by lead
instructor) of academic dishonesty will be reported, even if the
student believes they made an honest mistake, or no mistake at
all. We understand honor violations are stressful processes, and
thus we strive to only submit academic integrity cases when we
believe there is clear evidence that the academic integrity board
should review our findings independently.</li>
  <li>You may collaborate, to any degree you want, with anyone (even
outside of your group) on in-class or self-study exercises. These
will be clearly labeled, and are specifically not the course
projects (which explicitly disallow any form of collaboration).</li>
  <li>While we recommend you discuss the project specification with your
peers, you should basically never be getting help from peers about
your code. In particular, you should never be showing another
student your project code. If you do discuss coding about the
project with another student, it should only be in the abstract
(e.g., “can you use operator overloading to implement that?” or “do
you think it would be sensible to implement this with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">map</code>?”) and
not particularized to your codebase. We understand that this can be
a challenging line to walk, and thus, we recommend the following
heuristic: when talking to other students about code, discuss mostly
the in-class exercises and participation coding exercises.</li>
  <li>You may not “hard code” solutions to tests for projects. The TAs and
professor will audit all student solutions, and use automated static
analysis tools, to check for potential hard-coding or other
practices that circumvent the spirit of our automated
tests–hard-coding solutions is considered a particularly offensive
violation and will be immediately reported to the academic integrity
board.</li>
  <li>Cite all help other than the professor, T.A., and
required/recommended text (you are allowed to cite those if you
wish, but it is not required unless you are specifically told
otherwise). Proper citation is not sufficient to avoid any charge of
academic dishonesty (e.g., citing another student’s work from a
previous semester), but we will not be particularly focused on
copyright law and it is permissible to use small snippets of code
from Stack Overflow (or related sources such as books and notes)
that do not tangibly complete the substance of the project for you.
<strong>Again</strong>: You should <strong>never</strong> share code with another
student. This includes both sending a file to another student and
“over the shoulder” copying (even when, e.g., variable names are
changed, etc..). In the eyes of the instructor, these are both
equally bad. You should never be sitting and helping another along
by writing their code. By doing so you are both violating the honor
policy and disadvanting the student you are helping (as they may not
then properly learn the material).</li>
  <li>If a student is found (by the university academic integrity council)
to have violated the academic integrity policy, the instructor
reserves the right to impose any grade-related sanction they see
fit, up to and including course failure–regardless of the level
suggested by the academic integrity council.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="student-support">Student Support</h2>

<p>Syracuse University values diversity and inclusion; we are committed
to a climate of mutual respect and full participation. There may be
aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in
barriers to your inclusion and full participation in this course. I
invite any student to meet with me to discuss strategies and/or
accommodations (academic adjustments) that may be essential to your
success and to collaborate with the Office of Disability Services
(ODS) in this process.</p>

<p>If you would like to discuss disability-accommodations or register
with ODS, please visit their website at
http://disabilityservices.syr.edu. Please call (315) 443-4498 or email
disabilityservices@syr.edu for more detailed information.</p>

<p>ODS is responsible for coordinating disability-related academic
accommodations and will work with the student to develop an access
plan. Since academic accommodations may require early planning and
generally are not provided retroactively, please contact ODS as soon
as possible to begin this process.</p>

<h2 id="accreditation">Accreditation</h2>

<p>As part of the regular ABET accreditation process for the
undergraduate program in computer science, we may be collecting
samples of students’ work in each of our undergraduate classes.  As a
result, some of your labs/homeworks/exams may be photocopied/scanned
(or electronically copied) to be presented for accreditation at some
later point.</p>

<h2 id="student-mental-health">Student Mental Health</h2>

<p>Mental health and overall well-being are significant predictors of
academic success. As such it is essential that during your college
experience you develop the skills and resources effectively to
navigate stress, anxiety, depression and other mental health
concerns. Please familiarize yourself with the range of resources the
Barnes Center provides (https://ese.syr.edu/bewell) and seek out
support for mental health concerns as needed. Counseling services are
available 24/7, 365 days a year, at 315.443.8000.</p>

<h2 id="discrimination-and-harassment">Discrimination and Harassment</h2>

<p>The University does not discriminate and prohibits harassment or
discrimination related to any protected category including creed,
ethnicity, citizenship, sexual orientation, national origin, sex,
gender, pregnancy, disability, marital status, age, race, color,
veteran status, military status, religion, sexual orientation,
domestic violence status, genetic information, gender identity, gender
expression or perceived gender.</p>

<p>Any complaint of discrimination or harassment related to any of these
protected bases should be reported to Sheila Johnson-Willis, the
University’s Chief Equal Opportunity &amp; Title IX Officer. She is
responsible for coordinating compliance efforts under various laws
including Titles VI, VII, IX and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act. She can be contacted at Equal Opportunity, Inclusion, and
Resolution Services, 005 Steele Hall, Syracuse University, Syracuse,
NY 13244-1120; by email: titleix@syr.edu; or by telephone:
315-443-0211.</p>

<p>If you notice any incidents of harassment or discrimination in class
or related venues (Zulip, other chats with students), however minor,
please email me. You may wish to use an anonymous email service such
as https://anonymousemail.me/. Please feel free to tell me as much as
you feel comfortable.  As a notice: I am a mandatory Title IX reporter
and thus am legally-compelled to report incidents such as sexual
harassment, relationship violence, stalking, etc…</p>

<h2 id="zulip">Zulip</h2>

<p>Zulip is a messaging platform for teams. We’ll be using it for most
course management. This is the best place to get in touch with me for
one-off questions, ask for an appointment for office hours,
etc.. Email me if you have not been invited to the course Zulip.</p>
